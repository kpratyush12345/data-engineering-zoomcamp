    "The bruin lineage command is used to visualize the dependency graph between assets in our pipeline.\n",

    "It shows:\n",

    "- Downstream dependencies → assets that run after the current asset\n",
    "- The complete execution relationship between ingestion, staging, and reporting layers\n",
