    "You're building a pipeline that processes NYC taxi data organized by month based on pickup_datetime. Which incremental strategy is best for processing a specific interval period by deleting and inserting data for that time period?\n",

    "- replace - truncate and rebuild entirely\n",

    "Explanation - \n",
    "\n",
    "The time_interval materialization strategy is specifically designed for pipelines that process data in defined time windows, such as daily, weekly, or monthly intervals based on a timestamp column like pickup_datetime.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our NYC taxi pipeline, the data is naturally partitioned by time (for example, January 2022, February 2022, etc.). When we run the pipeline for a specific interval, we want Bruin to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Delete only the data for that specific time period\n",
    "- Insert the newly processed data for that same time period\n",
    "- Leave all other historical data untouched\n",
    "\n",
    "This is exactly what time_interval does.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why time_interval is the best choice\n",
    "\n",
    "When using time_interval, Bruin:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Uses a defined time column (like pickup_datetime) as the incremental key\n",
    "- Deletes rows only within the specified start_date and end_date interval\n",
    "- Inserts fresh, clean data for that interval\n",
    "- Prevents duplication\n",
    "- Allows safe reprocessing of specific months if needed\n",
    "\n",
    "This is ideal for pipelines that run on schedules such as daily or monthly."
