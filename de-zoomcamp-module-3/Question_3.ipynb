    "- BigQuery is a columnar database, and it only scans the specific columns requested in the query. Querying two columns (PULocationID, DOLocationID) requires reading more data than querying one column (PULocationID), leading to a higher estimated number of bytes processed.\n",
    "- BigQuery duplicates data across multiple storage partitions, so selecting two columns instead of one requires scanning the table twice, doubling the estimated bytes processed.\n",
    "- BigQuery automatically caches the first queried column, so adding a second column increases processing time but does not affect the estimated bytes scanned.\n",
    "- When selecting multiple columns, BigQuery performs an implicit join operation between them, increasing the estimated bytes processed"
